* Normalising and filtering - awareness of this happening may be limited if we just normalise it
* How can we talk about a value as being 'British' - fairly individual
    * Rule of law: who doesn't have this as a value?
    * Individual liberty: is this something particularly British?
    * Mutual respect: is this actually a value in society?
     * Tolerance: politicians at war with one another over Brexit - issue with the term tolerance rather than acceptance 
    * Values not from philosophers or historians but from the military - bizarre source
* Sense of confusion - young children having to be promoted values by law
    * How do you define the rule of law to young children?
    * We don't understand these values and we don't know who created them
    * Subjective to different people - vague but not so vague to use in a legal framework
* Are these values here to threaten the enemy? - paranoia around Islamic terrorism, or just applied to anyone who is considered a problem?
* Unquestioned values
* Racial aggrevated crime has risen after Brexit - as a society, we have legitimised the dislike and fear of the Other
    * Having to police fundamental British values - will this encourage us to be racist?
    * How are we positioned with those who are not British or do not share these values?
* Issue of colonialism as a history internationally - rise of zero-tolerance to past wrong
    * Part of the tradition and heritage - if these flow into the fundamental values that we are *forced* to use in education, what are the impacts for those children whose heritage links to bad history
    * British values in the English literature and history curriculum 
    * Issue of saying history is the reason for values because we have changed - but proving continuity and the value of the things put forward
    * Promoting a Victorian way of living in a modernised way - heading back towards the 19th century more than just in education
* Impact on social relations - a social elite decide what the values are and what is pushed forward - danger for social cohesion?
    * If this was applied to any other culture, we would consider it a threat
    * Emphasis of Western values
    * British values as good and correct - British interchangeable with good
    * Moral imperialism - modern vehicle for propaganda for British superiority
* Alienating people excludes them, self-excluding oneself as a result rather than conforming
    * If there is an awareness that people do not fit in, they may feel that their values have no value and they are more at risk of going to alternative communities
    * Battle over resources creating fear 
    * Government's attempt to push us to blame immigrants for problems rather than government's failed policy?
* Being dissatisfied with late-capitalist society is not the same as extremism
* Neoliberalism encouraging competition, and people who are not fitting into neoliberal values might be more excluded?
* Tight definition of what a British citizen is and they fit within the neoliberal structure
* Prevent claims to be open but most referrals are about Muslims; a third of all reports are from teachers
    * Conditioned to associate terrorism with Muslims
    * Less hysteria over the IRA attacks which were much more common than Islamic terrorism
* Right-wing media - narrow idea of what a Muslim identity is, but we are not very extensive in our view
    * Our culture *is* dynamic and multicultural
    * We rely on what we hear and read about the terrorism - imaginative perception
    * If we were suspicious of everything, where does it take us?
    * Dividing people to make it easier to manage people?
    * Lone wolf vs group terrorist identity
* Issue of net neutrality and targeting free speech and what people intake
