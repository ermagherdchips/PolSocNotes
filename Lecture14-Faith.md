    * Tension of religious groups; dissenters were 'outsiders within'
    * Gave grants to dissenters and CofE
    * Lack of state education here compared to Europe because we couldn't resolve who should teach, CofE or others

    * Day beginning with the glorification of God, but parents had the right to withdraw you from collective worship
* Religious education must be taught in schools, but is not compulsory and parents can withdraw their children from it
    * Sits alongside sex and relationship education 
    * Assemblies as a way of doing this alongside RE lessons

    * More likely to be in a faith school when young and less so when at secondary school
* Today: miniscule rise in the number of children in faith schools - other faith groups represented in this

    * City Technology Colleges as the modern day academies - sat outside LEA control and funded by state with private sponsors
    * Learning & Skills Act (Labour) introduced academies as they are - halved the amount of financial commitment to encourage more schools
    * Other act: one type of school could not have a religious character vs three other types that could: more types to have a religious character than not (expanding the number of faith schools)
