* Most ancient and current hot-topic for education 
    * Religious instruction was the foundation of an education
    * Tension of religious groups; dissenters were 'outsiders within'
    * Gave grants to dissenters and CofE
    * Lack of state education here compared to Europe because we couldn't resolve who should teach, CofE or others
    * Resolved: had to be non-denominational
* 1944 Education Act introduced the tripartite system
    * Day beginning with the glorification of God, but parents had the right to withdraw you from collective worship
* Religious education must be taught in schools, but is not compulsory and parents can withdraw their children from it
    * Sits alongside sex and relationship education 
    * Assemblies as a way of doing this alongside RE lessons
* 1979: children in religious schools
    * More likely to be in a faith school when young and less so when at secondary school
* Today: miniscule rise in the number of children in faith schools - other faith groups represented in this
    * Increase in CofE schools the most
* Education Reform Act 1988 (Conservative) brought in curriculum, GCSE provision, etc, and beginning of marketisation
    * City Technology Colleges as the modern day academies - sat outside LEA control and funded by state with private sponsors
    * Learning & Skills Act (Labour) introduced academies as they are - halved the amount of financial commitment to encourage more schools
    * Other act: one type of school could not have a religious character vs three other types that could: more types to have a religious character than not (expanding the number of faith schools)
* Education policy usually created from a group dynamic and different views - why expanding?:
    * Wanting to expand a religious ethos
    * Needing to comply to Human Rights laws that parents have the right to have/not have a religious education
* Tony Blair wanted to bring children closer to God and this was a good thing to do - taking advantage of policy to create social divisions and removing multiculturalism? (Toynbee disagreed this policy was forward-thinking)
* Media responses: shift from Christian schools to other religion 
* Weakening local government authority to see what was happening in schools - deregulation of schools allowed the Trojan Horse affair to happen; encouraging entrepreneurial people to set up faith schools (valued by neoliberal values) - people possessing these desirable character traits get on board and creating schools
    * None of this could have happened without educational reform
    * Suggesting extremists are pushing agendas and have hijacked schools misses the point - the conditions were set under neoliberalism for this to occur; by deregulating you must be open to the possibility that this might happen.
    * Response was enormous considering it was a hoax
    * Munich speech on DUO: fundamental British values
    * Secular public consciousness: but legally religion must be taught in schools - nothing within law allowing the government to say that there is going to be a non-religious value as an alternative to religion 
    * Situation where faith is in schools, always have, but we now have a non-religious other set of beliefs we have to subscribe to
* Clarke report (2014) and Casey Review (2016) were concerned about schools in Birmingham
    * Review identified barriers to social mobility
* Private faith schools (paid schools) not rated well by Ofsted; not very good because they resist British values?
    * Responses fuel groups to respond negatively of a 'threat'
* CofE as our mainstream religion - Spielman on her reports
* Removing critical analysis to just assume that these schools should just be shut down
* Jimmy Carter: 'we worship self-indulgence and consumption' - identity is shifted to materialism; saying this *before* neoliberalism comes in and sweeps away what remained of the Keynesian state 
* We no longer feel religious conviction - we are losing faith in Britain, not sure what a moral response to a situation is, thus left floundering not knowing who is judging us - background to the discourse of faith schools is one of cynicism in a context where we don't know what our beliefs should be anyway
