# Identity
* Theme of this term is identity politics and its impacts on education
* Where we are now and work backwards to see how we got to this point; future lectures about how this manifested

## Neoliberal people
* Neoliberal foundations govern our time
* Not asking *who am I*, but *what do I want* in a free society
    * Being able to ask this question presupposes that we have something we want
* Fraser believes this question has shut down identity around working-class movements
    * Getting one's voice heard and thus identity becomes personal - focus on I
    * Crept into politics that social injustice can be remedied by acknowledging everyone as individuals
    * Economic maldistribution is because we have stopped asking how it is fair to distribute to how we should recognise individual differences
    * Need to change economic things through taxation to have economic justice
* Moran - identity has been captured by capitalists to 'market' to us
    * What do I want does not become wanting fairness, but wanting nicer material goods - dumbed down into consumable things
    * What do I need to purchase to become an ideal self - problematic commodification of desire
* How this plays out in schools - Kinney argues that in order to have status at school, one needs to exercise economic capital to get into teams as a barrier of what is normal
    * Economic barriers to beingin the incrowd
    * Harm occurring to young people who cannot access the category which defines you as normal - serious issue
* Ball on neoliberal people - how economically mobile; not aligned with a nation state
    * People who are spatially mobile playing the international money game, not rooted in the way that other people who lack the economic capital are 
    * This sets the standard of us - we don't want to be tied to the issues of a nation; should be so busy asking what we want as individuals that we do not regard our nationalism
    * Cosmopolitanism sees 'winners' as people who are desirable
* Performativity (Ball) - Butler joins a distinction between gender performance (level of individual) and performativity (structural conditions we have to play within)
    * Away from education for experience (Dewey) to education for credations
    * Immersed into this as neoliberal people - pushing towards getting credentials without asking what the purpose of education is
    * We are obliged to keep up and we are labelled and blamed as failures if we do not
    * Losing if we do not win in this game of performativity - leading to student referrals to counselling, pressure from regulation
* Productive learners - OECD etc. culpable as students should not resist what happens in our society under neoliberalism with critical engagemnet but should hurry towards being winners within it
    * Austerity should not be seen as combatted, but individuals should compete against it and not be it
    * Graduate employment not at the level of the group, but should be internalised 
    * Awareness that under neolibrealism, there is an increase in youth unemployment which caused social agitation which they didn't want - to counter this, we bring more players into the game (not more winners) and get more students into higher education
    * Indoctrinating young people into seeing the game we're playing under productivity is worthwhile and one should go under it
    * If no-one came to university when fees were tripled, the game would have stopped - but enough people continued to play the game, and so on it goes
* Verhaeghe - before identity politics got going in the 70s, we would have discussions about people as a whole rather than about individuals
    * Focus on collective responses - took the pressure off individuals for life chances
    * If we think of identity as collective, there is less responsibility for it - if personal, it rises angst, which creates MH issues as people internalise the issues that were once group problems
    * Shifting away from social progress to individual progress - deeply unhealthy 
    * Rise in cosmetic surgeries as a far-end expression of this - making bodies the best to live in
    * Sees a link between the shift of identity to today's issues


## Critical theory
* Tension between reason and emotion inherited by enlightenment and romanticism
    * We are still informed by this tension - do we think our way to the correct cause of action or do we feel our way intuitively?
* rise of Fascism in the 1930s in Germany/Italy, Communism in Russia - Weber says that we are unsure of where we are heading with ideology
    * Lost the religious underpinnings of our selves - not part of the body politic anymore, not just preparing for the life to come in eternity
    * Focusing on the self took you aaway from God, needed to stay there
    * Fading away to the point that we have a sense of purpose, but no longer a religious purpose
    * If it is the pursuit of material goods, we are getting this and accumulating wealth, but what is this for?
    * Everything is just the nature of a sport - playing a game with no sense it will be more profound than a sport, no significance
* Frankfurt School - trapped with a sense of purpose, but not having it anymore
    * Writing in the time of foundational ideologies which do negate the individual - collective grind
    * Administered world? - ever-expanding network of management and control
* Horkheimer's idea of critical theory - Ward believes it is anti-foundational as it rejects normative judgements and looks instead to explain how oppression is created in society
    * Idea that if we become conscious of our oppression, we may become liberated from this oppression (not recognising the oppression of resilience discourse and thus not being able to Question it?)
* Examples of critical theories - considering these in future lectures
    

## Critical pedagogy
* Freire - Pedagogy of the Oppressed
    * Considring the iron cage of modernity - different genders and social classes - worlds within this world,but we are being crushed by stories told within our worlds within the world at large
    * Fictions are dangerous - powerful as they are translated into law, which translates into incarceration
    * Make us distrust one another to the point we cannot have authentic relationships - isolating as individuals which mean we are conditioned to think people are bad
* Wanting education for liberation, not for domestication - performativity, conditioned to succeed at degree stuff - enables us to challenge the rules of the game
* Rejecting bankign education - if we come to education with a stock of ideas and cannot maek links beetween what the teachers say, t will not becomem incorporated into the sense of who we are - dialogic realtionship helpst eacher to see wherer the leearner is to move forward into a deeper understanding than just regertigation
* Contemporary accounts of Freire prior to neoliberalism - acknowledged that he was helping ordinary people in Brazil through his method to overcome powerlessness and act on their path 
    * Enabling people to become critically aware so they can take action
* Strong legacy 

## Education in the age of identity politics
* Identity politics has not existed very long, but is scarcely written on as a phenomenon (lots on identity expression of individuals but less on how we came to this)
    * Counter-cultural revolution which frustrated people like Keith Joseph 
    * Product of the New Left - led to groups forming around particular causes like gender, sexuality, race
    * Issue with subgroups - immediate tendency to shout over one another of whose claim is more valid - we talk more of intersectionality now, but in its early days there was shouting down that experiences of one is more oppressed than others
    * Led to a weakening of the sense of a collective bond amognst people in terms of their economic status - we begin to think of ourselves as our political energies being removed from certain characteristics if it is not our key characteristic
    * If asking what we want, if the most important thing is a recognition of gender/racial struggle, this trumps other questions of what has happened to redistribution
    * Economic maldistribution has not thus been adequately challenged
* Gitlin - height of the academic culture wars - what is knowledge, what is the individual etc.
    * Saw this as a tragedy, not because he is oppressive, but that this fractured the colelctive responses, and capitalism required a collective response to not dominate individuals and people
    * Those who own capital are more powerful than those who just own their labour - if those with labour do not collectivise to protest capital, they will not have an effect
* At the same time, good things come from this - i.e. the Equality Act 2010
    * Brought on waves to acts of parliament which listen to the voices of groups who are oppressed 
    * An Act of Parliament is only as strong as the people who act to fulfil it - still being broken by some
    * Takes energy to commit oneself to a particular cause - if aligning the self with disabled community, that requires an effort reducing efforts for other things
    * Without people campaigning hard to demanding equality it wouldn't be happening - a lot of people were discriminated against
    * But then there is an issue that we need to all get back together to resist economic inequalities, which is difficult to do
    * Nothing preventing discrimination against class - neoliberal trumping class identity?
    * Myth that we can move beyond class, but we cannot move beyond fixed characteristics, leaving some behind, despite it being increasignly difficult to move beyond class
* Legally what schools must follow - not allowed to deny existence
* Hepple - we shouldn't take for granted policy that seeks to assist people - never going to have a government that says people are oppressed and they should be helped, as it takes people to push their concern which is exhausting but is the process
    * Years of dedciated process to demand equality - this gets forgotten
* We will never have progress against oppression unless people push for it
    * Ultimately need to see beyond our differences to see hwo we are connected and not lose sight of this otherwise we fall deeper into neoliberalism
