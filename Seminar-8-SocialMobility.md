# Social mobility
* Bloodworth's *The Myth of Meritocracy*
* We buy into the myth of qualifications as a lie 
* Social mobility not problematised in policy discourse
* Bloodworth says there hasn't been an increase in working-class women in education
* Social mobility more about cultural capital than academic qualifications 
* Unconscious biases towards working-class men as negative stereotypes 
* Education system geared up with the idea that everyone has cultural capital? - knowing Shakespeare becomes part of an employability skills set?
* Assuming knowledge based on an individual's presentation 
* Sense that you need to shape to the institution and belong otherwise it's the individual's fault
