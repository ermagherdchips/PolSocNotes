* Weber: not as connected as we were in feudal times
    * Quest to invent our own values - 'iron cage of modernity'
* Hayek agreed that there was an iron cage of modernity - rejected socialism as a pre-modern myth
    * Satisfaction through property rights - belief that would be enough for people
    * Andrew Gamble believes Hayek was wrong: developed a welfare system which showed there was a 'moral equality' between all people (everyone given healthcare)
* Thatcher got into the idea that socialism is a myth clinging onto the ideals of feudalism: no society, just individuals (and their families)
    * No such thing as entitlement - not entitled to get things without meeting an obligation
    * Harsh neoliberal view that never fully won over the people
* Jones saw Thatcher as determined to strip away class identity - idea we are aligned to the self and not to a class
    * Creating entrepreneurs: depending upon the self and not needing the government to provide welfare support or employment guarantees
* Punk response in the 1970s: Thatcher wanted to remove the idea that the state would owe people a living - now shifted
* Who do we blame for the erosion of the state in society: the failure of the left to articulate a response to neoliberalism?
    * Bound up in identity politics
    * Finding moral equivalence between people - division in the left
    * Social left argued that identity politics was problematic
    * Cultural left argued that Marxist theory is blind to difference and that identity politics is necessary (lumps everyone together as the proletariat and not recognising differences)
    * Left forms an uncomfortable alliance with neoliberalism - particularly with females, this allows progress - critical of the female liberation movement that aligned with market society and the entrepreneurial individual in a market society rather than questioning things from the neoliberal politicians
    * Under-researched - what happened to the fragmentation of the left
* Michael Young - meritocracy
    * IQ (what we're born with) + Effort (how hard we work) = Merit
    * People rewarded based on their merit
    * Worry that it will create an aristocracy of talent - if IQ is low, even with the effort is high the merit will not be as good as people with high IQ
    * Not a moral equivalence here
    * Lilico - goes against human feelings of affection
    * Though it was a warning against meritocracy, politicians followed this formula and want to create a meritocracy
* Social mobility [Bloodworth](http://library.dur.ac.uk/record=b2876961~S1)
    * Individual mobility - limited space at the top, one moves up and one moves down
    * Structural mobility - expansion of white-collar jobs to allow for more room at the top (expansion of high-paid jobs)
    * Low-skilled labourers recommended to reskill - people left to a life of no prospects
    * Social mobility more real in the post-war period when jobs were needed - not happening anymore
    * Needing more and more education to get less and less of what's on offer in the job market
* APPG on Social Mobility (2011): bought into the myth of the entrepreneur 
    * Needing more entrepreneurial characteristics - resilience etc.
    * Character-training young people does not create more space at the top but more disgruntled entrepreneurs
    * If not expanding the number of white-collar jobs, they are just creating more dissatisfied people
    * Investing thousands of pounds into debt to not get a job
* DfE bought into the discourse of the entrepreneur
    * 'Desirable character traits' 
    * Myth that people want to buy into and believe - inventing values within the 'iron cage of modernity' 
    * Cannot just give better academic attainment - having instruction in resilient character isn't enough for some children
    * 'Valued by employers' - not wanting to encourage the traits liked by employers if they don't like people who strike or complain about wages or things like that - wanting drones
    * Having to do something specifically 'British' - desparate attempt to fashion some values to attach to education without tackling structural inequalities
* SMCP / SMC - removing a reference to poverty as soon as it becomes an issue
    * Threat of Britain 'becoming a permanently divided nation' - chances of coming out of poverty are impossible
    * Due to loss in WW2, we needed more civil servants/solicitors/teachers - jobs have now changed and people stay poor
* Most recent report, State of the Nation (2017)
    * What's the point of looking into social mobility if the government ignore what people say? 
    * Possible to break the trends, but insights are not being applied
    * Why does the government encourage people to look into social mobility and then ignore/ eternally 'look into' the findings??
    * As long as everyone is bought into the myth of the entrepreneur, no one complains about it
* Everyone on the board quits - protesting
    * Theresa May's claim she is in favour of social mobility not going to action
* Media reports on social mobilty - background continues to make a difference
    * If you fit with the establishment, you are more likely to get more promotions and earn more
* Social mobility indicators are unfair:
    * Not able to choose these things and it still leads to a lower lifetime outcome
* Argument of nature vs culture 
    * Nature - idea that people are just born that way
    * Culture - if we don't have inequality, how will we have success? (inequality encouraging progress); can't have a winner without a loser (viewed as an Olympic event)
* Increased spending on education has done **nothing** to decrease income inequality
    * Meritocratic model used as a justification for inequality - claiming people haven't put in the effort and therefore lose
    * Internalising this - people perceiving themselves as a failure and concealing the inequalities and unfairness of the system
* True aim of meritocracy to enable the 1% - allowing people to get away with draining resources from people so poverty becomes others' success
* Jones *The Establishment*: why are we not outraged about this? The more the failures of the system are made public and the more people vote in favour of it, the easier it is to justify it
* NE Child Poverty Commission 
* Creating myths around education and what it offers - when called out as a myth, no one minds... 
* Failing to address child poverty and social mobility 
* Education on its own cannot address structural inequalities
