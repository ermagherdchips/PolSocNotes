# Disability
* SEN statements carry funding - only a minority of a minority receive support
    * Support occurring with no additional resources to support the child - significant costs of hours of support and resources 
* Medical model of disability was an early approach
    * Butler Act (1944) sneaked in the medical model - IQ tests to all learners to decide which school they go to
    * Also identified categories of 'handicap'
    * Epilepsy not identified as needing a special education now
    * Maladjusted - children on the autistic spectrum
* Segregation - child assigned to a separate school or separate classes 
* New sociological perspective because children lacked a childhood
    * Routines of these schools were not geared around the children's needs but the staff's
    * Post-structural critique - power of the doctor vs the power of person with disability/parents
* Push towards inclusion through the Warnock Report
    * Translating these things into practice
    * Written from the perspective of the learner - laments the distortion of her ideas
    * If we think of all children as the same disability, it is problematic 
    * Telegraph article - 'cynical betrayal'
* Outspoken about the censorship of her report - Thatcher says she isn't allowed to discuss Dyslexia in the report because there was a perception that it didn't exist and that middle-class parents used to get advantage for their children who weren't as academic
    * Not allowed to identify the link between deprivation and language deficiency
    * Issues around child development could be addressed at the economic level, but governments are unwilling to do this
* Desire to protect children - UN Convention 
    * Children have a right to access education
* UNESCO Treaty - culturally sensitive whilst acknowledging that children have rights that cannot be trumped by adults
* Salamanca Statement - importance of inclusion 
    * Not wanting to separate children, but to celebrate diversity in mainstream settings
* Global Campaign 
* Social model of disability - as a society, we can create disabling environments through negligence
* Disabled community at the heart of the research - inclusive, seeking the views of the people to whom this is a lived experience
    * This paradigm is important - actively sitting with the researcher can be an affirming experience
    * Idea it is unethical to conduct research with obscure groups of people who do not have this disseminated to them
* New Labour's disability policies fit in to the neoliberal agenda - compromising inclusivity agenda
    * SENDA: illegal to discriminate pupils because of their disability - not answering the question of how to provide the service, meaning that children may go to the school and not be able to access the service
    * Not wanting disabled students to protect their league tables and school funding - nuisance to some 
    * Statistically a child not looking good on the paper but having life-threatening illnesses
    * To get around SENDA, parents may be bullied by the schools to withdraw their children 
* UN Convention: 'Reasonable accommodation'
* In HE, we have DSA as a 'reasonable accommodation' - but not enough money for students
* Jo Johnson saying that DSA should be complementary to the support put in place by HEIs
    * Other institutions or businesses (e.g. cinemas) providing better support than universities
    * Lecturers picking up the slack that universities do not provide - lecturers are not experts and do not receive training on how to support learners with disabilities of all kinds
* NUS Paper on the DSA cuts - concern with the restrictive definition of disability
    * Dyslexia the largest category of disability in HE but not given support from DSA
* Inclusive education aligned with performativity is problematic
* Multicultural theory align disabled communities as victimised but similar to LGBT+ or ethnic minority communities - if you take away discrimination, these people can live a non-stigmatised life; but these people have specific needs that can only be met if there is in place packages to do so - compensatory and redistributive programmes 
* Currently, disability is lumped in with other welfare - complex system
    * Insufficient incentivising those with severe disabilities from joining the workplace - issues with this
    * Must put in place resources to support people - can't say that people cannot work, and these people are expendable
* Obvious that this draft would violate the UN convention, but still drafted 
    * UK as the first and only country to be investigated for violating the convention
    * UK disabled community persecuted by the government
