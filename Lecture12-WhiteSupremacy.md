# Education as an act of white supremacy?
* Lecture 12 will be recorded and uploaded to DUO
* Title is questioned - proposing it is but not asserting it 
* White ethnicity census - America and the UK are white-majority countries despite the news suggesting otherwise
* Gillborn interested in critical race theory - we don't question the extent to which white people in the UK have privilege that is taken for granted - not a fringe racism that is dangerous, but this unquestioned norm
* Unconscious performance - Butler and performativity around gender; we are also performing our ethnicity 
* Reiteration of whiteness: being white is normalised and taken for granted in a default setting - Chetty's example that 'stories are about white people' - is this because educational stories are about white people? - racism is engaged with metaphor, as stories about harmony are through animals rather than with different people?
    * Difficult for children to see this as a metaphor for race interaction, they just know about the animals
    * Considering HP: considered to be championing the underdog, but he argues that the lack of racial minority characters is limiting if they only use elves etc. to explore racial inequalities - arguable that it is representing British society with few characters; backlash when Hermione's actress was black in Cursed Child
    * Not questioning this normalisation
* Levitt's *Freakonomics*: issues suggesting that it is not structural oppression that causes crime 
* Institutonalised racism (Jones paper on DUO) - how do we ensure as a society that the cards are stacked in favour of the white majority as there are changing demographics? - housing, emdicine, education etc. as key to controlling access to material and educational capital which would ensure the white majority maintain their position of power
* *13th* Netflix film: race in the US - we are not too far behind in the UK
* David Lammy - helping white people acknowledge how white people are maintaining privilege in society: for the same crime, more black women/men are sent to prison than white men/women
* The Ungrateful Country - despite having access to privilege from the best education in the country, he was tired of British racism: driving out talented people because of race issues
* Critical race theory: not just about acknowledging there is racism, but looking at how education is used to maintain white supremacy and how white privilege is normalised in education 
* Race Equality Teaching Journal - identifying good teaching measures so teachers can adjust what they are doing to be more aware and better in practice to help promote fairness in society
* Gillborn argues that education policy legitimises and makes worse race equality
    * Q1: who are the game changers and are in power? - colourblind politicians attempting to be sensitive but not able to claim to be colourblind as we are a racially divided country; actually saying this and then acting racist; artificial bias as a belief that ethnic minorities have an advantage in education when really it is a disadvantage, or the claimed actions to create advantages are nonexistent
    * Q2: who wins and loses?  
    * Q3: outcomes - expectations orient teachers; how teachers tend to have lower expectations of a group and set them less challenging work and not push them if they are not expected to be good
* DfE The Importance of Teaching - claiming that black boys and poor children have disruptive behaviour and need their 'lives back on track' - nonsensical race/class prejudiced writing in policy
* In the US: overcrowding/overpolicing in American schools, so regimenting things to become out of control
* Joseph argues children's lives have been lost because of a lack of nurses/counsellors - happening in the university sector too 
* No choice but to endure racial discrimination as a student nurse
* Boliver - not creating equality in the UK HE sector - UCAS still not name-blind - unconscious prejudice; personal statement/extra-curriculars perhaps should be given less advantage in admissions
* Runnymede Trust - UN Committee aware that it is everywhere; telling UK Gov they need to urgently address the fact that BME students receive lower degree classifications than white students in HE - students who have to do additional working whilst studying can impact grades hugely
* Rise of populism compared to a rise in CRT - backlash against cosmopolitanism/multiculturalism; governments across Europe showing power not by protecting the people in the country but by keeping out others - shift from Keynesianism care for the people towards pushing people away 
* US Education Secretary as an example of a despisal of experts - religious views - this is what politicians believe that we want
* Rise of the alt-right and the impact of this in education: Breitbart magazine with rightwing articles - mythical ideas pushing that minorities have more opportunities than white people 
* White supremacist community in the EU: as a 'bastion of whiteness'
* 'Dear Justine' letter from the EAL association to Justine Greening - migrant children positioned as a problem for teachers who need EAL support which drains resources; we were failing to recognise that Britain is a multilingual society in a multilingual society and that this is not a negative thing, but something that is exciting in an interconnected world
* Resistance to white supremacy: idea that speaking against something normalised makes one a hero; not succumbing to this thinking that has been incredibly negative in the past
* Civil rights movement working from divisions in education - hard fought for struggles against division and oppression are coming back
