# Education in Youth Custody
* Report: to inform politicians  
    * 1000 children, 10-17 year olds 
    * Different types of institution - determining who goes where is based on the Youth Justice Board (usually what's closest)
    * Qualifications vary - meant to be delivered up to GCSE, but patchy
    * 90% of these children have been excluded from school - if not getting along in mainstream school, is this a risk factor?
    * Higher incidences of neurodisability - greater concentration
    * Dyslexia - struggling in school, feeding into other issues which may make them disruptive in schools - risk factor for educational disengagement if coupled with other problems
    * Vulnerable young people with significant impairments in ability 
    * Emotionally and physically damaged
* Report from Ofsted - Expectations for the Education of children in Prisons
    * Need to have access to SEN specialists who can provide proper frameworks of support for children in prison settings
    * 'Robust' - how is this defined?
    * Tapping into other requirements around the provision of faith/citizenship education - enshrining these same values
    * Ofsted not usually picking up on cancellations of classes in mainstream schools - needing to log this
    * Vogue for self-assessment where children can monitor their own progress - just flung this in?
    * PE also an expectation in mainstream schools - asking the children what they want to do in terms of physical exercise and act upon it - strange that adults are not deciding what the education should be for them, rather than asking the students what they want to do (esp. when they have disabilities) - should be designing things for them?
    * Appropriate resources is just a given in mainstream education - suggests that this is not always available in prison schools
* Contentious issue of restraining children in custody 
    * Corporal punishment was banned in 1986 - illegal in mainstream schools to physically hold a child - not the case in prison schools
    * Toxic and difficult to get hold of these documents
    * Using de-escalation - ways to minimise the need to restrain
    * Is the use of restraint closely monitored? The removal of funds since the 2010 Coalition and the downsizing of staff makes it harder to look after the children - questionable of who monitors this and who ensures children are restrained correctly?
* Journalism reporting what is happening behind close doors
    * Dangerous restraint techniques - children already had injuries, and then at risk of catastrophic injury 
    * These are children being looked-after by the state 
* Viewing these statistics in the day-to-day experience of these children - raising questions of whether the state has contributed to their deaths through their treatment of the children
* The children who end up in youth custody are often not viewed in the same way as other children, so they have to state that 'the death of any child is a tragedy' - these things should go without saying
* Article 39 Charity - UK as a signator to the rights of a child, and thus bound by international law to have a duty of care to these children
    * Social Work Bill privatises the care of children - desire to marketise 
    * Charity lobbying to remove this power - House of Lords tried to ban profit-making - but stalled under Brexit
* BBC Journalism bringing into public consciousness that this is a for-profit advent now
    * When breaking up the welfare state, it is difficult to know how you will turn these things into profit-making activities
    * Ofsted found that levels of violence are high - suggests it is not being monitored properly
    * Why trying to privatise when the state has to step back in and take over the running?
* Same person who wrote the Trojan Horse report writing the Prisons annual report
    * Slippage in the ages - conflicting bits of information 
    * Only two deemed reasonably safe, none safe - children trapped in an environment that is not safe - instincts in a non-safe environment is to flee - if you can't flight, they have to fight, because they are fearful of assault 
    * Not even receiving a weekly visit if a looked-after child
    * Breaking laws for the protected characteristics - cooped up in a fight or flight model that does not permit flight
* 'Tragedy is inevitable' - tragedy is already happening; at what scale would this be? - no single safe establishment, yet they are still running
* How can students engage in education when there are traumas around them - 'angry, frightened, broken and fragile' - how do we as a society get to the point where our children are behaving in such a way that they end up in these institutions? - not blaming the children but blaming society; not properly asked
* Good work being done at the margins by people who understand the value of progressive education aligned with Eisner on how children can be engaged in society - all humans have creative capacities 
* Engage reporting on the work they have done with these children - recognition that pride and achievement is important for children we may, as a society, want to dismiss
* The Ministry of Justice have an employability focus - the arts are more than just educational engagement and careers; idea that the arts can reduce reoffending is problematic and views it less expansive than Eisner and more of a diminuation of what the arts can give to young people

# Education for adults in prison
* Risk factors of being in care, unemployed, regular truancy at school, and family criminal offences, literacy and numeracy problems, mental illness, substance abuse - if born into a poor community, a mental health problem alone can escalate whether they go to prison
* Why do we put people into prison for committing a crime? - two missions
    * Retribution and rehabilitation - punishing and fixing
    * Depriving of a liberty of movement as an acute pain
    * Idea of people being less adequate and the education mission making them suitable for the world outside
* Prisoner identity - Foucault and deviance in Ward & Connolly paper on DUO
    * Rendered deviant by society, enveloping in theory-driven intervention
    * Performing their reformation within the prison setting
* Privatised prison system and the highest rate of imprisonment
    * Uncertainty of the future of this on tender - slicing into three-year funded projects
    * Funding by results encourages providers to limit the education - easy short courses to hit targets, not being too ambitious 
* Impacts of neoliberalism on prison education - distortion of education to fit a statistic - the people in prison suffering from learning disabilities are not targeted for interventions; people at the bottom and top of the spectrum ignored in the education
* Peaks and troughs of despair and hope in prison education - employability should not be driving the curriculum, needs to be deeper; creative arts gives value and meaning to lives
* Since 2012, austerity has resulted in a decline in prison safety - overcrowding and underresourcing will result in this deterioration
* Everything in this has stopped to focus on Brexit - no provision as it is lost in the snap election
